How to Solve Sudoku Game using C Programming

I have written a program in C to solve sudoku Puzzle in easy steps

Your task is to take a sample sudoku either from newspaper or from internet and try to write it down in the output screen as follows:

1   6   4   0   0   0   0   0   2

2   0   0   4   0   3   9   1   0

0   0   5   0   8   0   4   0   7

0   9   0   0   0   6   5   0   0 

5   0   0   1   0   2   0   0   8

0   0   8   9   0   0   0   3   0

8   0   9   0   4   0   2   0   0

0   7   3   5   0   9   0   0   1

4   0   0   0   0   0   6   7   9

Here 0 represents the blank spaces which will be filled by the program as soon as you will completely represent it the way i have suggested you above.

After writing every row, press enter to add numbers in new rows.

Also make sure that you have to provide spaces between numbers in every row as shown above.

After hitting the enter button, you will be able to see the solved sudoku
